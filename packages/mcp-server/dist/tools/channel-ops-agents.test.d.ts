/**
 * THE MULTIPLAYER OPS — `dopl_channel` agents / summon_agent / rename_agent /
 * set_agent_status / disengage_agent / join_thread / leave_thread.
 *
 * Two things are pinned here, and the second is a security property:
 *
 *  1. WHAT EACH OP DOES. A handle resolves to a row of THIS channel (so
 *     `rename_agent` sends an agent ID even though the caller typed `@quartz`),
 *     a join sends the right `{kind, id}` pair, and every refusal says what did
 *     NOT happen — an agent that reads "nothing changed" does not retry blind.
 *  2. NARRATION. An agent HANDLE is member-typed and an agent's OWNER NAME is
 *     `profiles.display_name`, which nothing in the product validates. Both
 *     land in lines this tool wrote, outside any untrusted-content framing, so
 *     both go through the neutralizer — and NO handle is ever rendered without
 *     its immutable id, because the handle is the owner's claim and the id is
 *     the server's record.
 *
 * The forgery payload and its assertions are the SHARED ones
 * (`narration-fixtures.ts`) — a private copy is how an assertion drifts into
 * meaning something weaker. The @dopl/client is hand-stubbed; nothing
 * transports.
