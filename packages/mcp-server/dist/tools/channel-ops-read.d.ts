/**
 * `dopl_channel` READ op handlers: list (channels), read (messages), await
 * (long-poll for new messages), list_threads / get_thread. All non-mutating.
 * Routed from the registrar in channel.ts.
 *
 * BOUNDARY: the wire/storage name `task` == the domain name `thread` — the
 * `thread` op param still resolves against `channel_tasks` rows and the
 * `/tasks` routes underneath `@dopl/client`.
 *
 * Every clock that bounds the `await` hold — the poll size, the assembled
 * hold, the env lever, and the deadlines they must fit under — lives in
 * `channel-await-budget.ts`. Read that file before retuning any of them.
 *
 * Every STRING these ops emit — the author labels, the thread renders, the
 * channel lines, and the untrusted-content headers that frame them — lives in
 * `channel-render.ts`. That split is where the peer-authored-text discipline is
 * documented and enforced (Q1); this file is control flow.

 * moment anything arrives is what keeps a reply fast; holding past ~2 minutes
 * when nothing does is what makes the pending call a wake primitive.
 *
 * Four results, never a thrown error once the hold is underway: new messages, a
 * timed-out note that tells the caller to re-arm (with a stop condition), a
 * FAILED-MID-HOLD note that names what broke and re-arms on the same cursor,
 * or — when the hold ended far under what was asked for with no error at all —
 * a CUT SHORT note that tells the caller NOT to re-arm and to report it.

/**

 * The gap this closes: `op="list"` reported "5 members" and NOTHING in the tool
 * said who they were, while `post` and `create_thread` both require addressing a
 * specific member and an unaddressed ask in a 3+ member channel triggers nobody.
 * An agent could see that a channel was a group, could be told to address one
 * member, and had no op that would tell it which members existed.
 *
 * Read-only, and it renders exactly what the roster route returns — the private
 * per-member preferences (notify scope, agent tool profile) are already scrubbed
 * server-side for everyone but the caller, and none of them are rendered here.
