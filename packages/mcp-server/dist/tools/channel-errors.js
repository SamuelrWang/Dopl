/**
 * `dopl_channel` API-ERROR CLASSIFICATION — what a 4xx from the channels routes
 * actually means, read off the error CODE rather than guessed from the status.
 *
 * Q9 — the write ops used to catch a bare `status === 400` and answer with a
 * fixed sentence blaming the addressee. `to` is required for `create_thread`,
 * so EVERY 400 got that sentence with no fall-through: a 240-character title
 * (rejected by the route's own zod schema, before `createTask` ever ran) came
 * back as "invite Bob first", and `op="invite"` then answered "Bob is already a
 * member" — two contradictory errors, no path forward, and nothing anywhere
 * naming the real cause.
 *
 * The code was there the whole time. `DoplApiError` parses `{ error: { code,
 * message } }` into `.code` / `.apiMessage` (packages/dopl-client/src/errors.ts)
 * and every channels-route 400 carries one — `HttpError.toResponseBody()` makes
 * that unconditional. The tools simply discarded it. This module reads it,
 * duck-typed on the shape so nothing has to import the error class across the
 * @dopl/client boundary (the same discipline as `respond.ts`'s isNotFound /
 * isConflict / isAlreadyExists).
 *
 * The `channel-` filename prefix is required by the parity split-scan
 * (parity.test.ts).
