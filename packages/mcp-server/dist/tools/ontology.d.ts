/**
 * `dopl_ontology` — the workspace object graph as a ROUTING layer. Read funnel:
 * anchor → map → resolve → get. Writes edit ONE thing at a time so agents never
 * round-trip whole objects. ⚠ There is no delete op and no
 * `dopl_ontology_admin` (deleted 2026-09-02) — deletion is app-only, fenced by
 * `sessionOnly` on the object and cluster DELETE routes. The `remove_*` ops here
 * strip a FIELD from an object that survives; they are not deletes.
 *
 * Thin registrar: one tool schema wired to
 *   - `ontology-render.ts`    — shared ref resolvers + object renderer
 *   - `ontology-ops-read.ts`  — map/anchor/resolve/get
 *   - `ontology-ops-write.ts` — op dispatch + every mutating handler
