/**
 * `dopl_channel` op="read" with wait_ms WITH NO `channel` — the WORKSPACE-WIDE hold.
 *
 * ⚠ `channel-` filename prefix required by the parity split-scan
 * (parity.test.ts).
 *
 * ⚠ **A SIBLING OF `channel-ops-hold.ts`, NOT A BRANCH INSIDE IT.** The two
 * share every CLOCK (`channel-hold-budget.ts`) and every rule about what a hold
 * may CLAIM (`channel-wake-guidance.ts`), and they deliberately do not share a
 * function: the per-channel op's whole result vocabulary is written around ONE
 * named channel — its re-arm call, its not-found, its stop rule all splice
 * `ref` — and threading an `undefined` ref through that would produce sentences
 * with a hole in them at exactly the moment an agent is deciding what to do next.
 *
 * ⚠ **ONE CURSOR IS LEGAL HERE BECAUSE `seq` IS WORKSPACE-GLOBAL AND GAPPY** —
 * the same property that makes a per-channel seq RANGE meaningless as a message
 * count. Ordering by it interleaves channels in true arrival order, so advancing
 * to the highest seq on a page means everything below it has been seen in EVERY
 * channel on the page.
 *
 * ⚠ **IT WATCHES CHANNELS THE CALLER IS A MEMBER OF, AND SAYS SO.** A PUBLIC
 * channel they never joined is NOT watched — narrower than `op="read"`, on
 * purpose (the argument is in
 * `src/features/channels/server/repository-await-workspace.ts ›
 * listMemberChannelRefs`). The result states the scope rather than leaving an
 * agent to infer it from an absence, because "no messages" and "that room was
 * never being watched" are different facts and only one of them is a reason to
 * keep waiting.
