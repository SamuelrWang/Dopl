/**
 * server.ts — BOOT A SESSION AND WIRE ITS TOOLS. Nothing else: resolve identity
 * and workspace, build the gates, build the two registration helpers, hand them
 * to the domain registrars. Every layer it used to contain is a sibling:
 *
 *   instructions.ts        MCP `instructions` briefing + shared workspace copy
 *                          (`buildInstructions`, re-exported below because
 *                          `factory.ts` and four suites import it from HERE).
 *   workspace-directory.ts membership cache, `workspace=` resolution, the
 *                          fail-closed no-default refusal.
 *   gating.ts              THE FOUR GATES + their tables. ⚠ Read that file's
 *                          header before touching either registration path.
 *   delete-policy.ts       the delete refusal AND the description `_admin`
 *                          tools advertise.
 *   registrar.ts           `registerTool` / `registerMetaTool`, workspace arg,
 *                          `strictInput`, ALS routing.
 *   status-footer.ts       the `_dopl_status` footer.
 *   meta-tools.ts          `list_workspaces` + `current_workspace`.
 *   resources.ts           the MCP RESOURCES — today the channels doctrine,
 *                          which is where the prose the tool descriptions and
 *                          write results used to repeat now lives.
