# Open questions (overnight run 2026-10-26)

Workers append a `## <slice>` section per question: the question, what was chosen, where.

## Phase 1 UI primitives (branch `ui/port-primitives`)

1. **Moving `PairedAvatar` whole would break the landing demo.** Its raised frame needs
   onboarding's `web-pieces.tsx › Profile`, and `banner-demo/*` (off limits this phase) calls
   `thinFrame`. Chose: the thin recipe moved to `src/shared/ui/identity-face.tsx › IdentityFace`;
   `onboarding/components/paired-avatar.tsx › PairedAvatar` keeps its props and renders
   `thinFrame` through `IdentityFace`, and keeps the raised onboarding frame. Onboarding importers
   needed no change. Retire `PairedAvatar thinFrame` with the banner-demo swaps (R2).
2. **`channels-staging/data/staging-agents.ts › stagingIdentityFace` builds face DATA (photo,
   colour, logo), not markup.** Kept as the staging data source; every renderer of it is now
   `IdentityFace`.
3. **Which badge shadow is the recipe?** Staging `TaskFace` used the bevel only; `PairedAvatar`
   and the identities fork used bevel + two drops. Chose the latter as the token
   `--raised-light-drop` (globals + tokens.css), read by `IdentityFace` and onboarding's `Face`.
   The tasks faces' badges gain that soft drop.
4. **Which status pill is THE pill?** Three faces exist: the tasks word pill, the demo agent card's
   `.lp-demo-ac-status` (2px pad, weight 500, dot) and identities-staging's white-on-hairline
   `StatusPill`. Chose the tasks geometry for `.status-pill` with an optional dot; the other two are
   not swapped (not a direct swap). Needs Samuel's pick before Phase 3 restyles agent cards.
5. **`CARD_BUTTON` lives in `channels/components/bits.tsx`** (the channels tree is the rename
   worker's this phase). Not touched; DESIGN-SYSTEM's `PILL_BUTTON` row names the family and
   leaves `CARD_BUTTON` for the channel page restyle.
6. **`AvatarStack` vs the identity stack.** Product `AvatarStack` callers (relationship list etc.)
   must not change look this phase, so `IdentityStack` was added beside it in `avatar-stack.tsx`.
   Collapse them when the product callers are restyled.
7. **Visual deltas accepted (all small, all toward the shared recipe):** settings cards
   `#ffffff` + 6/16/.04 shadow → `.white-card` (`#fefefe`, `--shadow-bento`); Add members
   initial circle and "Member" pill → `IdentityFace` / `StatusPill` (raised hairline, `--bg-inset`,
   `text-micro`); the quick view's "All tasks resolved" gains the check icon its tab twin has;
   outlined pills `#ffffff` → `--bg-overlay`; an agent with no colour key rings `neutral` instead of
   `agent-01`; an identities run with no runtime keeps its agent-colour ring (was grey);
   `PairedAvatar thinFrame` without a logo draws no badge (was a grey block).
8. **13px was already a token** (`--text-lead`); the staging literals now read it. 15px was missing
   and is `--text-heading` (both token files, DESIGN-SYSTEM type table).
9. **Pre-existing red, not this slice:** `src/shared/ui/clickable-cursor.test.ts` flags
   `ontology-staging/ontology/components/kanban-column-header.tsx` (untouched here).
   `identities-staging/page/identity-activity-panel.test.ts › scopes every rule to .uis-window` was
   red on master (unscoped `.uis-tk-idface*` and `.uis-st-people*` rules); green now, since both
   rule sets were deleted for the shared primitives.
